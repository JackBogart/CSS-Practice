        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>Hi there! My name is John Bogart, and I am currently a junior at Rutgers University pursuing a degree in
            Computer Science. My passion for technology and problem-solving led me to this field, and I am excited to
            continue learning and growing as a developer. In my free time, I enjoy coding personal projects, playing
            video games, and staying active by hiking and playing recreational sports.</p>
